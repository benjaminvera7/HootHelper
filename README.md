# Hoot-Helper-v1.5
This app takes a properly formed (hootsuite) content .txt file and schedules the content into a CSV file for uploading to Hootsuite. (2013)

I had written some Powershell scripts to help with this problem and wanted a UI to run them. 
I used C#/WinForms to create a UI wrapper for these scripts.

It's a frankenstein of PowerShell & C#
